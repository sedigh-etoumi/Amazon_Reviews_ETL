# Amazon_Reviews_ETL

Overview: 
  In the assignment we are going to analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows           manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who     are then required to publish a review. So we are going to transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, Iâ€™ll     use PySpark, to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

Analysis and Results:
- Filter the data and create a new DataFrame or table to retrieve all the rows where the total_votes count is equal to or greater than 20 as the following.
