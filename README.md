# Amazon_Reviews_ETL

Overview: 
  In the assignment we are going to analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows           manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who     are then required to publish a review. So we are going to transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, Iâ€™ll     use PySpark, to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.

Analysis and Results:
- Filter the data and create a new DataFrame or table to retrieve all the rows where the total_votes count is equal to or greater than 20 as the following.

- Filter the new DataFrame or table created in Step 1 and create a new DataFrame or table to retrieve all the rows where the number of helpful_votes divided by             total_votes is equal to or greater than 50%.

- Filter the DataFrame or table created in Step 2, and create a new DataFrame or table that retrieves all the rows where a review was written as part of the Vine program (paid), vine == 'Y'.

Repeat the previous step, but this time retrieve all the rows where the review was not part of the Vine program (unpaid), vine == 'N'.

Determine the total number of reviews, the number of 5-star reviews, and the percentage of 5-star reviews for the two types of review (paid vs unpaid).

Summary: As the percentage of 5 stars paied reviews up to 51% we can significantly notice there is a bias for reviews in the Vine program.
